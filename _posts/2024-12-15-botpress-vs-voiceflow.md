## What is Botpress?

**Botpress** is a flexible and powerful platform designed for developers who want to create advanced, customized chatbots. It’s an open-source platform, meaning you can tailor it to meet your needs, but it requires a fair amount of technical knowledge.

### Cons of Botpress:

### Botpress

- **Integrations**: Botpress supports a wide range of integrations, from CRM systems to APIs, making it suitable for businesses that need a highly customizable chatbot.
- **Resources**: While Botpress has a strong community and comprehensive technical documentation, it’s geared more towards developers, so support may not be as accessible for beginners.

### Voiceflow

- **Resources**: Voiceflow has an abundance of beginner-friendly tutorials, templates, and community support. It’s a great choice for those looking for hands-on guidance.

## Which One is Right for You?
